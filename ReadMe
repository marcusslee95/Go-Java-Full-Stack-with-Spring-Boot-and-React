In "github-repo-for-growth-team-interview-prep-app" I have code for an earlier version of the project that uses hardcoded values from backend as a mock database. In this repo I have code that uses values from a real h2 db.


- React App created using create-react-app
- Added Bootstrap for styling
- Used JS's sessionStorage to send over token when user logs-in & delete token when user logs-out
- Will start w/DB used in course - h2 in-memory db - before moving onto PostgreSQL version actually created the PostgreSQL version in another GitHub repo called "Connecting-A-Java-API-to-PostgreSQL-DB-practice"

-----

So this repo is essentially 1. updated version of the app in "github-repo-for-growth-team-interview-prep-app" (version that uses h2) 2. work i did in later sections (sections after ch 6) - like using JPA to interact w/a db
